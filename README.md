# A Simple SSID Probes Sniffer
Based on https://github.com/adamziaja/python/blob/master/probe_request_sniffer.py

Based on Scapy. Nothing special.

## Usage
Just `make`. It runs `make prepare`, which puts the interface into monitor mode and `make run`, which runs the script.

Optionally specify `IFACE` as the interface name
